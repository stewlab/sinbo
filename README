about sinbo .01 written by stateq2

I am a novice programmer, and this is my very first SDL game 
(not nearly a game.....yet).  So if the code looks like a n00b wrote it,
that's because a n00b DID write it.  I need help w/ it, and this release
is just to put it on the net so i can get some help, like how to control 
the framerate (cause the ball moves at warp speed).
